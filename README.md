# image_moderation_app

Mini Flutter Project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I tried to implement the use of Google Vision API to be able to moderate images that people select. This was attemoted by calling the API using its token and sending a selected image stored as a variable.
I then attempted to breakdown the repsonse request sent back with the data containing all the different sections it moderated it on to be displayed with the image itself.

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
